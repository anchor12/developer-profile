# Developer Profile

This application allows the user to input a github username and colour, and produce a HTML page with the github user profile details. The HTML page will also be styled using the colour that the user typed in the console.

The information about the users Github is obtained from the Github API. This includes the Github users location, number of followers, number of repositories, user bio and the users avatar from their Github profile page.
